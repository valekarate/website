    <h2>BRINGING THE CURTAIN DOWN ON 2015!</h2>
    <!-- 76 -->

<p>The December Grading has traditionally always been a busy and exciting weekend
for Vale Karate, as all students, with the exception of our many Black Belts,
aim to finish the year having secured their next belt!</p>

<p>The long weekend of Saturday 12th &amp; Monday 14th December was such a time, with
almost one hundred Vale Karate students giving the grading their best shot.</p>

<p>We have changed our Tigers policy recently, with parents of 6-year-old Tigers
who have attained at least Yellow Belt, now having the option of switching their
little one's to the General class and syllabus.</p>

<p>All our classes are fun, but a more disciplined atmosphere is evident in our
General classes than classes for Tigers, so these classes are not suitable for
very little ones, but development of those who are ready is definitely more
rapid.</p>

<p>This has proven a popular option, as after the Tigers Grading, which featured
ten 4, 5 &amp; 6 year-Old beginners and relative beginners passing to their next
belt, half a dozen six-year-olds joined the older Beginners, Yellow Belt &amp; Red
Belt class, and held their own alongside the older children.</p>

<p>Vale Karate has long been Wales' biggest club, and although we made the decision
to streamline Vale Karate in 2015 (we are no longer in Schools and now having no
other clubs under our wing) and as a result we are definitely smaller than we
have been, our numbers remain impressive and all Grading groups, were of a
healthy size and more importantly (much more importantly) of a healthy quality!</p>

<p>We have also changed the syllabus recently, expecting our students to
demonstrate an improvement in physical strength as well as in knowledge and
technique, and this has also proved the right decision, although not universally
popular with the students!</p>

<p>It is always hugely satisfying to witness the many children and fewer adults
demonstrate their improvement, and often witness some of Vale Karate's future
stars finding their feet and beginning to show their potential and this grading
delivered plenty!</p>

<p>With no hiccups from the developing groups on Saturday, which ran from 9am until
4.30pm, there were even more nerves evident on Monday as the Brown Belts, who
although they have seen many Grading's come and go, had to raise the bar
considerably to continue their progress.
This was one of our busier Brown Belt Grading's with Six 3rd Kyu Brown Belts and
ten 2nd Kyu Brown Belts undergoing the rigorous grading.</p>

<p>Only those who have a very good chance of passing are given permission to
attempt the grading, with always a number being disappointed to be told they are
not yet ready (not a pleasant part of Sensei Rob's job!) it is nevertheless a
stressful experience for examinees and examiner alike and it was again a huge
relief when no errors were made at any point to ensure a 100% success rate!</p>

<p>It was then the turn of four youngsters, all girls, to undergo an experience
they'll remember forever, their Dan Grading!
Danica, Siobhan, Ella &amp; Lauren have all shown considerable improvement since
they achieved 1st Kyu, which Vale Karate rules demand was a minimum of one year
prior, and ready for the challenge.</p>

<p>They were joined by Sensei Kee who was attempting his 3rd Dan, nineteen years
after he achieved 2nd Dan!
His family and career have put Karate on the back burner in the intervening
years (decades) but he has never stopped training or teaching, providing much
support in the past to his good friend and another of Sensei Rob's treasured
students, Sensei Andrew Kanias, now a 5th Dan and Chief instructor to the
successful Kansei Karate Schools.
Kee was also invaluable (alongside Sensei Helen, Sensei Andrew and our friends
from Merthyr Sensei's Lyn, Kay &amp; Richard Powell) when Sensei Rob has been abroad
with the Karate Wales squad a number of times in 2015.</p>

<p>All five examinees reached snd surpassed Sensei Rob's expectations, each meeting
the challenges given to them with their utmost determination.</p>

<p>The many nervous families and friends of the examinees were invited into the
dojo for the ceremonial presentation of Diploma's and Black Belts and as is
always the case, many tears of joy and relief were shed.</p>

<p>With the Grading's brought to a conclusion, there was only one day of training
left, the 'End of Year' Fun classes!</p>

<p>Tuesday saw three classes; 6pm Tigers, 7pm all older children and adults up to
4th Kyu, 8pm Brown &amp; Black Belts.</p>

<p>Sensei's Rob &amp; Leah took the Tigers class, with fun &amp; Karate Games on offer
before the dojo was filled with our mid grades.</p>

<p>Sensei Kee led the warm ups for this and the advanced class, with Christmas
tunes blaring and 90% of students wearing Christmas Hats complimenting (?) their
karate uniforms, then he introduced his own variation of 'the twelve days of
Christmas' with press-ups and sit-ups accompanying each 'number' sang!</p>

<p>Kata in 'Ra' (mirror image) with mistakes or being last to move, leading to
press-ups and various variations on a theme were led by Sensei Rob before the
balloons made their appearance to the delight of the children and the despair of
the adults!
Bursting balloons with punches can be harder than it sounds and each success was
greeted by a round of applause!</p>

<p>Dozens of burst balloons later the Dan Grade class was brought to a close with a
tense and hilarious game of 'Sensei Says' with Tomos &amp; Bethan each winning a new
quality Karate Suit as joint winners.</p>

<p>Goodie Bags were distributed, which each containing among other assorted goodies
a Newsletter and a Christmas Bauble with the Japanese calligraphy 'Kara' &amp; 'Te'
hand painted on each (all done by Sensei Rob &amp; Cathy)
(They hope the hours spent in this was appreciated!)</p>

<p>A fantastic end to another successful year for Vale Karate.</p>

<p>Anyone who wasn't present at our 'End of Year' classes (why?) and would like a
Newsletter, please email Sensei Rob for a digital version or pick one up in the
New Year.</p>

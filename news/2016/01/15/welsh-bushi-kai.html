    <h2>WELSH BUSHI-KAI INVITATIONAL</h2>
    <!-- 78 -->

<p>Only a week after the KARATE WALES YOUTH OPEN, Neath Sports Centre
was the venue, when our friends from the Welsh Bushi-Kai hosted their
Invitational Championships.</p>

<p>A break from the norm for us as it's a while since we competed under WKF rules,
and we faced squads we haven't seen for a while.
Only a small Vale Karate squad attended, but nevertheless dramatic results were
seen!</p>

<p>The day started with Brad James replicating his result from Merthyr with another
bronze in the U14 Special Needs Kata.
Amelie Fisher at only six, amazingly won her pool in the burgeoning 9 &amp; Under
Kata, she lost her semi final, but a bronze was a brilliant result!</p>

<p>Griff Hughes and Chiara Baker shone as they each won Gold10-12 Boys &amp; Girls Kata
respectively, a pleasing turn of events saw Griff meet team-mate Jack George in
the final!</p>

<p>Leah Copeland has consistently shown she's Wales' top all-rounder and was again
in dominant form as she delivered sparkling performances of Bassai Dai,
Gojushiho Sho and Gojushiho Dai to take gold and later won four tough fights
against good opposition to take Kumite gold!</p>

<p>Josh Dwyer, continued in the vein which saw him take the Karate Wales title, to
secure Gold in the U16 Boys Kumite, though this was an even bigger task, and
perhaps as satisfying a win as he moved up to the U16's.</p>

<p>Harrison Williams may well have given Josh Dwyer a run for his money, but was
injured, with his opponent penalised, but as Harrison, was unable to continue
due to medical advice, his opponent won...</p>

<p>Therefore the Vale U16 Boys team which needed only two to compete, was down to
One.<br>
Josh.<br>
Brandon Harvey from the Ken Bu Kan was drafted in and as both he and Josh each
won all their team fights, another gold to the Vale!</p>

<p>Hopes af another gold, from our U14 Boys team of Jack, Max and Chris were high
as all these boys have huge ability, however it wasn't to be as they were
defeated by their great friends and rivals from the Ken Bu Kan and left with
bronze medals.</p>

<p>Alysha Lee, Ella Forsyth &amp; Lauren Moran are turning into a very impressive
trio, all working hard to improve!<br>
Alysha met Ella in the semi-final of the Girls U14 Kumite and although the match
ended in a draw, WKF rules meant the officials then voted for a winner with
Alysha getting the nod.<br>
She couldn't quite manage to win the final, but great performances from the
girls nevertheless!<br>
They then put in the performances of their lives (so far) to take Gold for Vale
in theU14 Girls team event!</p>

<p>Kloe Christoforato went one better than the previous weekend, taking a silver in
the quality U16 Girls Kumite.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Brandon Harvey of Ken Bu Kan who helped Josh &amp; Harrison to
Team Gold and very special mention to Leah who once again epitomised our
'all-round ethos' by taking yet another kata/Kumite double!</p>

<p>A big thank you to The Welsh Bushi-Kai for staging a great, friendly and high
quality event.</p>

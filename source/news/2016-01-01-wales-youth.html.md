<h1>KARATE WALES YOUTH OPEN JAN 2016</h1>

<p>With the Christmas &amp; New Year break over, the Vale Karate Squad needed to hit
the ground running, as one of the biggest events of the domestic Calendar took
place on the 24th January, when Merthyr was the venue when Karate Wales Ltd,
hosted their Youth Open Championships.</p>

<p>A number of special guests had been invited in view of the magnitude of the
event including the Mayor of Merthyr, Councillor David Isaac and the CEO of
Merthyr Council, Gareth Chapman.
The Special Needs Kata category medalists were presented with their medals by
the Disability Sport Wales Officers for Merthyr and the Vale of Glamorgan, Dan
Bufton and Simon Jones.</p>

<p>Medals in all categories were hard won as quality squads from all over England
and Wales were present.</p>

<p>KarateSport England attended in strength and emerged with seven gold medals to
top the medal table.</p>

<p>Vale Karate were again Wales' most successful club, with four gold, four silver
and ten bronze medals, though they were run very close by the mighty Ken Bu Kan,
who were third on the table only by virtue of fewer bronze medals than Vale.</p>

<p>Disability Karate Wales (St Pats) brought their Special Needs squad to Merthyr,
and took the Lions share of medals in the two Special needs Kata events, however
the Vale duo, Lucas Widdrington &amp; Bradley James were not to be denied, taking
the gold and bronze medals respectively in the U14 category.</p>

<p>As all categories were 'Open grade' our less experienced competitors were up
against it, but great performances from Rhydian Pullin, Greg James and Nathan
Shepherd in the 9-10 Boys Kata saw all three winning medals. Although the gold
was beyond them, the potential they displayed was immense. Nathan is not yet
Brown Belt, so a silver medal was a great result!</p>

<p>Ella Lyons is improving constantly, and in the high quality 9-10 Girls Kata, a
bronze medal was a great result.</p>

<p>Griff Hughes and Chiara Baker, competing in the 11-12 Boys &amp; Girls categories
respectively, are two of Vale's and indeed Wales' hottest Kata talents and each
tussled for the gold medal. Chiara was 0.1 point ahead of the field after the
first round, but 0.1 behind Cardiff's Aliyah Wiley in the final round.</p>

<p>Both were then required to perform another Kata to break the tie, and to the
relief of Vale supporters, Chiara took the Welsh title!</p>

<p>Griff was 0.1 behind the brilliant Glory Bimbi of ESKF England after one round
and was unable to close the gap, again 0.1 behind in the final round to take the
silver medal.</p>

<p>Emma Squire is one of our most skillful Kata competitors but has been unable to
train much lately and therefore struggled with consistency in the 13-15 Girls
Shotokan Kata. Her excellent Kanku Sho moved her up the ranking in the final round,
but a slight wobble cost her the silver medal, winning a bronze on this occasion.</p>

<p>The only category which included Karateka over 21 was the Parent &amp; Child Kata,
and Vale were again represented on the podium as Mike &amp; Jack George took bronze
medals.</p>

<p>The first Kumite category, the 7-8 years Boys event saw Kian George fighting
with his customary fearlessness to earn a bronze medal to open Vale's Kumite
account.</p>

<p>Chiara Baker, after her Kata heroics got stuck into the Kumite!
Although still generally known as a Kata Champion, she leads the WKL Kumite
rankings! That is no accident as Chiara demonstrated in Merthyr, going all the
way through to the final to take the silver medal and very narrowly missing the
elusive Kata/Kumite double.</p>

<p>Jack George has stepped up to a new level over recent months, shown dramatically
when he took a Kumite Double at the prestigious and very high quality UWK
England Open in November.
He continued in that form, beating the Ken Bu Kan's Morgan Harvey in the final
of the 11-12 Boys Kumite.</p>

<p>Karate Wales is awash with talent in the 12-16 age range, and this was apparent
as Wales dominated these age categories, especially in the boys events.</p>

<p>Our own Josh Dwyer and Harrison Williams are right at the front of this new wave
and Josh took Vale Karate's fourth gold with a great win in the 13-14 +50Kg
category. Harrison came so close to earning another gold and whitewashing the 13-14 Kumite
for Vale in the -50Kg event, but the Ken Bu Kan's Josh Davies snatched victory
from him.</p>

<p>Kloe Christoforato, although still only 15, has a dozen years of Karate behind
her and called on that experience to take a bronze medal in the 15-16 years
Girls Kumite.</p>

<p>The final categories to take place were the team Kumite events.
Vale had only two teams entered with both the Vale 9-10 team of Rhydian, Nathan
&amp; Greg and the 13-14 Boys team of Harrison, Josh &amp; Max taking further bronze
medals.</p>

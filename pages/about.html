<h2>Karate for Everyone</h2>

<p>Vale Karate is a family-run professional Karate Organisation established and run
by Chief Instructor Rob Copeland 6th Dan and secretary Cathy Copeland and based
at Barry YMCA Hub and in schools across Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan.</p>

<p>Vale Karate has a comprehensive timetable of classes running throughout the week
with all classes taken by Rob Copeland. Our timetable includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Classes for children from four years; &#39;The Vale Karate Tigers&#39;</li>
<li>Separate Children&#39;s Beginners and Intermediate classes</li>
<li>Advanced classes</li>
<li>Adults traditional Shotokan sessions</li>
<li>Classes for children with Special Needs</li>
<li>Competition Specific sessions in Kata and Kumite.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rob and Cathy also run After School Karate classes in local Primary Schools.</p>

<p>Vale Karate really is Karate for Everyone. We aim to make each students time
with Vale Karate, be it a week or two, or a lifetime, enjoyable and beneficial.</p>

<ul>
<li>A place to meet old friends and make new ones.</li>
<li>A place to improve your fitness and wellbeing, reduce stress and take
    advantage of the wide array of benefits Karate delivers both physically and
mentally.</li>
<li>A place to learn the absorbing and challenging art of Shotokan and the
exciting Sport of Karate.</li>
</ul>

<p>The sporting side of Karate is not for everyone, and we offer a host of
&#39;traditional&#39; classes, but we believe competitive Karate can be a vitally
important stepping stone towards a fulfilling and successful Karate career.</p>

<p>For the past decade Vale Karate has had the most successful karate squad in
Wales.</p>

<p>The Vale Karate Squad in excel in both aspects of competitive Karate; Kata and
Kumite.</p>

<p>We&#39;re proud that we compete successfully in both aspects of competitive Karate
wherever we go. We believe in a competitive, sporting ethos and in giving those
who want to compete the very best chances of being successful.</p>

<p>Chief Instructor Rob Copeland withdrew Vale Karate from the Welsh Karate
Governing Body (WKGB) in 2012, but during the years between 2000 when Vale
Karate was established and 2010, Vale Karate were dominant, winning One Hundred
and sixty WKGB Welsh titles and Twenty-One BKF British titles as well as a
European Silver medal, World Universities Bronze medal and gold medals at the
Commonwealth Karate Championships, Kamacho Open, French International Open for
teenagers, Belgian Open, Junior Austrian Open, Czech Open and Celtic Cup.</p>

<p>Vale Karate also counted among our membership many WKGB Welsh International
Competitors.</p>

<p>In 2012 we were among the founder members of a new Governing Body for Karate in
Wales: <a href="http://karate-wales.org">Karate Wales.</a></p>

<p>Through Karate Wales all our members are fully insured and have experienced new
and exciting opportunities.</p>

<p>Vale Karate through our Governing Body Karate Wales, is affiliated to WUKF and
the IKU.</p>

<p>Affiliation to these World Body&#39;s open up a host of opportunities for our
competitors and those interested in officiating.</p>

<p>In 2013 Karate Wales sent a sixty-strong Squad to the WUKF European
Championships in Sheffield. Vale karate came back with a gold medal and two
bronzes.</p>

<p>In 2014 Karate Wales sent a squad of forty to the WUKF European Championships
in Verona Italy. Again the squad were very successful with Vale Karate members
winning two gold, one silver and one bronze medal.</p>

<p>In 2011 Vale Karate embarked on a new competitive adventure, The Welsh Karate
League.</p>

<p>The WKL is a fantastic opportunity for our youngsters in particular. Nine events
per season take place around Wales with the results tied together, so although
each competition stands alone, there is also a structure to find the season&#39;s
champion of champions!</p>

<p>In our first season no fewer than thirteen squad members won Champion of
Champions trophies!</p>

<p>We also won the Most successful Club award.</p>

<p>Vale Karate were the &#39;most successful club&#39; in the following two seasons and are
destined to remain so this season.</p>

<p>However; although we are definitely a &#39;sport oriented&#39; club, it is plain to see
that we offer something for everyone.</p>

<p>Karate is more than simply a sport and we aim to ensure that training with Vale
Karate is an extremely positive experience for absolutely anyone.</p>
